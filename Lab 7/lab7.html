   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Two queue classes were discussed in the lectures. One implemented a queue
   using a linear linked list of nodes. The other implemented a queue using a
   circular array. For this lab assignment, you must implement an iterator for
   the queue class that uses a circular array.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Suppose that we want to visit the elements stored in a sequence, like a
   stack or a queue. Also suppose that we are not allowed to modify the
   sequence to visit its elements. Then we can visit a sequence&rsquo;s
   elements by using an <i>iterator.</i> An iterator is class whose
   instances can visit the elements of a sequence. Each iterator typically has
   a method called <tt>hasNext</tt> that tests if there are more elements
   to be visited. It also has a method called <tt>next</tt> that returns
   the next element to be visited, and advances to the following element. An
   iterator that visits the elements of a linked stack was discussed in the
   lectures.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can simplify an iterator&rsquo;s design by
   assuming that the sequence will not change while we visit its elements. For
   example, if we use an iterator to visit the elements of a stack, then we
   assume that the stack will not be <tt>push</tt>&rsquo;ed or
   <tt>pop</tt>&rsquo;ped. Similarly, if we use an iterator to visit the
   elements of a queue, then we assume that the queue will not be
   <tt>enqueue</tt>&rsquo;d or <tt>dequeue</tt>&rsquo;d. If a
   sequence changes while an iterator visits its elements, then the actions of
   the iterator become <i>undefined</i>&#8212;which means they need not
   work correctly after that happens.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must add the following members to the class
   <a href="ArrayQueue.java">
    <tt>ArrayQueue,</tt>
   </a>
   whose Java source code is available on Canvas. These members implement an
   iterator for <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. You are not allowed to modify
   <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> except to add these additional members.
  </p>

     <p align="justify">
      This class must be nested inside <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. An instance of
      this class may be used to visit the current elements of an instance of
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>. It must have one or more private variables that
      let it &lsquo;&lsquo;know&rsquo;&rsquo; which elements of
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> are to be visited next. You must decide what
      those private variables are. Hint: you need not copy the array from
      <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>.

  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   This gives us a different kind of iterator from the one discussed in the
   lectures, and also different from the ones provided by Java. It does not
   have a <tt>remove</tt> method, and it is not accessed through an
   interface.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be careful to put all class members in the
   right places. For example, the class <tt>Iterator</tt> must be nested
   inside the class <tt>ArrayQueue</tt>, and the method <tt>next</tt>
   must be nested inside the class <tt>Iterator</tt>, etc. If the members
   are in the wrong places, then the iterator will not work.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The file
   <a href="tests7.java">
    <tt>tests7.java</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains Java code that performs a series of tests. The tests call
   methods from the <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> class and your
   <tt>Iterator</tt> class. Some of them print what those methods return.
   Each test is also followed by a comment that tells how many points it is
   worth, and optionally what must be printed if it works correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>3. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This lab is worth <b>20 points.</b> Run the tests, then turn in their
   results, along with Java source code for the modified
   <tt>ArrayQueue</tt> class with your <tt>Iterator</tt> class in it.
   Your work will be due at <b>11:55 <small>PM</small></b> on
   <b>Wednesday, November 4, 2020.</b> If you do not know how to turn it
   in, then please ask your lab TA&rsquo;s.
