   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This laboratory assignment involves implementing a data structure called a
   <i>map.</i> A map associates objects called <i>keys</i> with other
   objects called <i>values.</i> It is implemented as a Java class that
   uses arrays internally.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   A map is a set of <i>key</i>-<i>value</i> pairs. Each key is said
   to be <i>associated</i> with its corresponding value, so there is at
   most one pair in the set with a given key. You can perform the following
   operations on maps.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p>
    You can test if a key has a value in the map.
   </p>
   </li><li>
   <p>
    You can add a new key-value pair to the map.
   </p>
   </li><li>
   <p>
    You can get the value that is associated with a given key.
   </p>
   </li><li>
   <p>
    You can change the value that is associated with a given key.
   </p>
  </li></ul>
  <p align="justify">
   For example, the keys might be <tt>String</tt>’s that are the
   English words for numbers. The values might be <tt>Integer</tt>’s
   that are the numbers corresponding to those words. If you give the map an
   English word (like <tt>"ten"</tt>) then you can get back its
   corresponding number (like <tt>10</tt>).
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maps for this assignment use arrays, and
   they work by doing linear search on those arrays. As a result, if a map has
   <i>n</i> pairs, then its operations may need at most
   <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) key comparisons. However, there are better ways
   to implement maps, using data structures that we have not yet discussed in
   this course. These require only <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) or
   even <i>O</i>(1) key comparisons.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must write a Java class called <tt>Map</tt> that implements a map.
   To simplify grading, your class must use the same names for things that are
   given here. Your class <tt>Map</tt> must have two generic class
   parameters, <tt>Key</tt> and <tt>Value</tt>, so it looks like
   this. Here <tt>Key</tt> is the type of the map’s keys, and
   <tt>Value</tt> is the type of the map’s values.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>class&nbsp;Map&lt;Key,&nbsp;Value&gt;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br>
    <tt>{&nbsp;</tt>
    <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8942;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br>
    <tt>}</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Within the class <tt>Map</tt>, you must have two <tt>private</tt>
   arrays called <tt>keys</tt> and <tt>values</tt>. The array
   <tt>keys</tt> must be an array whose base type is the class parameter
   <tt>Key</tt>. The array <tt>values</tt> must be an array whose
   base type is the class parameter <tt>Value</tt>. Suppose that a key
   <i>k</i> is found at the index <i>i</i> in the array
   <tt>keys</tt>. Then the value associated with <i>k</i> is found at
   the same index <i>i</i> in the array <tt>values</tt>. Do not try
   to use only one array, because that will not work.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must also have a <tt>private</tt>
   integer variable called <tt>count</tt> that records how many elements
   of the arrays are being used. You may also need other <tt>private</tt>
   variables that are not mentioned here.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your class must have the following methods.
   Most of them use <tt>count</tt>, <tt>keys</tt>, and
   <tt>values</tt> somehow. Some methods are <tt>public</tt> and
   others are <tt>private</tt>. The <tt>private</tt> methods are
   helpers for the <tt>public</tt> methods; they may make your code easier
   to write. Also, any key may be <tt>null</tt>, and any value may be
   <tt>null</tt>. This will affect how you test if keys are equal.

   When you compile your program, you may see the following

   Ignore them. As discussed in the lectures, these messages appear because
   Java does not implement class parameters (the names between
   <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt>) correctly.

   on Canvas contains Java code that performs a series of tests, worth 40
   points. Each test calls a public method from your class <tt>Map</tt>,
   and prints what the method returns. Each test is also followed by a comment
   that tells how many points it is worth, and what it must print if it works
   correctly. You may want to run additional tests, but you don’t get
   points for those.
