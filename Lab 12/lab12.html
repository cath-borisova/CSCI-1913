   <i>This is the last Java lab for the course!</i>
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this laboratory assignment, you will write a Java method that sorts a
   linear, singly-linked list of integers using a version of the Selection Sort
   algorithm. This shows how it is possible to sort sequential data structures
   other than arrays. It also gives you some practice manipulating lists.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Suppose that we have a list of integer keys:
   [3,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4]. (This is not Java&rsquo;s notation, but
   mathematical notation.) We&rsquo;d like to make a new list that is like this
   one, but in which the integer keys are sorted into nondecreasing order:
   [1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4]. One way to do that is by using an
   algorithm called <i>Selection Sort,</i> which can be described by the
   following pseudocode.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p>
    Let <i>unsorted</i> be a list of integers to be sorted. Let
    <i>sorted</i> be [&nbsp;], an empty list.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    If <i>unsorted</i> is empty, then stop. The list <i>sorted</i>
    contains all the original elements of <i>unsorted,</i> sorted into
    nondecreasing order.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    Select the largest integer <i>max</i> from <i>unsorted.</i> If
    <i>max</i> appears more than once in <i>unsorted,</i> then select
    any one of those appearances, arbitrarily.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    Add <i>max</i> to the front of <i>sorted.</i> Delete
    <i>max</i> from <i>unsorted.</i> If <i>max</i> appears more
    than once in <i>unsorted,</i> then delete any one of those
    appearances, arbitrarily.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p>
    Go to step 2.
   </p>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">
   As you can see from this description, Selection Sort gets its name because
   it repeatedly <i>selects</i> the largest integer from
   <i>unsorted</i> and adds it to the front of <i>sorted,</i> until
   <i>unsorted</i> becomes empty. Selection Sort is a naive sorting
   algorithm that requires <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&#178;) key comparisons
   to sort a list of <i>n</i> elements. This is because the loop in steps
   2&#8211;5 runs <i>n</i> times, and within that loop, it takes at most
   <i>n</i> comparisons to select an element in step 3.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection Sort can be implemented to sort
   arrays, but in this laboratory assignment, you will write a method that uses
   it to sort a linear, singly-linked list of Java <tt>int</tt>&rsquo;s.
   You can use anything you know about these lists to write the method,
   including: adding nodes to the front of a list, deleting nodes from anywhere
   in a list, using head nodes, and the left-right trick. You may need to use
   other things too.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other algorithms that can also sort
   linear singly-linked lists, but are far more efficient. One is
   <i>Mergesort,</i> which can sort a list of <i>n</i> elements in
   only <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) key
   comparisons, much better than <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&#178;). However,
   we don&rsquo;t care about Mergesort here.
  </p>

   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The file
   <a href="IntySortyList.java">
    <tt>IntySortyList.java</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains Java source code for a class called
   <tt>IntySortyList</tt>. It contains an inner class, a private variable,
   and some methods, described below.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <dl compact="compact">
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>private class Node</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      An inner class, used to build the singly-linked linear list of integers
      whose head node is <tt>first</tt>. Its <tt>int</tt> slot
      <tt>key</tt> is one of the integers in the list. Its
      <tt>Node</tt> slot <tt>next</tt> points to the next
      <tt>Node</tt> in the list, or to <tt>null.</tt> Don&rsquo;t
      write this, or change it: it&rsquo;s written for you.

    <dt>
     <p>

     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Constructor for the class <tt>Node.</tt> It initializes a new
      instance of <tt>Node</tt> whose <tt>key</tt> slot is the
      parameter <tt>key</tt>, and whose <tt>next</tt> slot is the
      parameter <tt>next</tt>. Don&rsquo;t write this, or change it:

     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>private Node first;</tt>
     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      The head <tt>Node</tt> of a singly-linked linear list. This list
      contains the integers to be sorted by the method <tt>sort</tt>. It
      is made by <tt>IntySortyList</tt>&rsquo;s constructor, and printed
      by the method <tt>toString</tt>.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     <p>
      <tt>public IntySortyList(int ... keys)</tt>

     <p align="justify">
      Constructor for the class <tt>IntySortyList</tt>. It returns an
      instance of <tt>IntySortyList</tt> that contains the integers given
      to it as its arguments. These integers are in a singly-linked linear list
      whose head node is <tt>first</tt>. For example,
      <tt>new</tt>&nbsp;<tt>IntySortyList()</tt> returns an empty
      instance (written as <tt>[&nbsp;]</tt>), and
      <tt>new</tt>&nbsp;<tt>IntySortyList(3,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4)</tt>
      returns an instance that contains the given integers (written as
      <tt>[3,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4])</tt>. Don&rsquo;t write
      this, or change it: it&rsquo;s written for you.

     </p>
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Sort the integers in the list <tt>first</tt> into nondecreasing
      order. Then let <tt>first</tt> point to the resulting sorted list.

    <dd>
     <p align="justify">
      Return a <tt>String</tt> that says what integers are in the list.
      This is used for printing. For example, it might return strings like
      <tt>"[&nbsp;]"</tt> or
      <tt>"[3,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4]"</tt>. Don&rsquo;t write
      this, or change it: it&rsquo;s written for you.
     </p>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Hints: you can write additional &lsquo;&lsquo;helper&rsquo;&rsquo; methods
   if you wish. The list <tt>first</tt> can contain any
   <tt>int</tt>&rsquo;s, not just the ones shown in examples.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to select a maximum element
   and delete it, in one pass through a list, using only one loop. It is also
   possible to write <tt>sort</tt> so it doesn&rsquo;t make any new
   <tt>Node</tt>&rsquo;s, and runs in <i>O</i>(1) extra space. You
   need not write your code to work that way, but it might be fun to try it
   (for some non-standard definition of the word <i>fun</i>).

  <p>
   <b>3. Deliverables.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   Add your Java code for the method <tt>sort</tt> to
   <tt>IntySortyList.java</tt>. The file
   <a href="tests12.java">
    <tt>tests12.java</tt>
   </a>
   on Canvas contains a driver class, whose <tt>main</tt> method tests
   your <tt>sort</tt> method in the usual way. Run the tests, for a total
   of <b>30 points.</b> Turn in <tt>IntySortyList.java</tt> with your
   <tt>sort</tt> method in it, and the Java code for the driver class, all
   in one file. Put the printed results of the tests in a comment at the bottom
   of the file. This laboratory assignment will be due at <b>11:55
   <small>PM</small></b> on <b>Wednesday, December 9, 2020.</b>
